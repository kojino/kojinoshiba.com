          <p class="mt2">Abe’s love for technology began in a remote village in Ethiopia where he was born. He took apart the radio his mother had, the only technology for miles on end, to turn it into a fan. At the age of 14, he got his first computer. His first company was started not long thereafter. He has since started and grown several startups, become an avid software engineer, and developed a keen interest in project management. Abe combines his skills as a developer with operational expertise not often found in CS students.</p>

Everything we’ve seen Adrian create since he joined Make School has reached a level of polish above and beyond what you’d expect from a single developer. He has a great product sense and is incredibly dedicated to becoming a stronger engineer - he’s blown us away with his technical understanding and work ethic. The products he builds speak for themselves.</p>
